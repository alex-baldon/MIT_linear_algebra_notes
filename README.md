# MIT_linear_algebra_notes
Notes from the free online Linear Algebra course in python; https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/

This is a work in progress; notes taken from MIT Professor Gilber Strang's text book 'Introduction to Linear Algrebra', focusing on the mathmatical foundation of Graphs... meant to eventually be a one stop shop for business professionals looking to leverage Graphs in their operations. 


TARGET AUDIENCE: I am creating this with the goal of teaching Python and linear algebra to my neice, so the language of the notes is simple by design.
